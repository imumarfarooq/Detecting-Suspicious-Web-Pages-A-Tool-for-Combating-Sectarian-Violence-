# Detecting Suspicious Web Pages: A Tool for Combating Sectarian Violence between Shia and Sunni Muslims

## Abstract

In present time the internet is the most effective, convenient and fast mode of sharing information and ideas. Though this facility is made for the ease of people all over the world yet a lot of people and groups of people use this facility to spread negativities around the globe. Nowadays the internet is being used by a lot of groups who share data that directly leads towards the sectarian violence and specially the two major sects i.e. Shia and Sunni. In recent years, rigidity between the two major brands of Islam that is shia and sunni has been noticed to an increasing extent not only in Pakistan but all over the world. Our project aims to detect such web pages which cause the conflict between shia and sunni. 

A web app based GUI is developed. Once a user enters a URL of any web page, the whole data of that web page is crawled and based on our fetched training data it classifies that web page as suspicious or not suspicious.
